# MindMapping

i was trying to find more ways of being creative by chatting with chatgpt and it mentioned [mind mapping](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map).

pretty cool idea, so this is going to be a super customized interface for mind mapping.

the challenge for me is:
1) make an appealing UI for once
2) my first single-page application
3) my first time using tons of keybind listeners
